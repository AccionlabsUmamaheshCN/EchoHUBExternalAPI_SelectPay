   This API is consumed by the SelectPay portal application and allows the SelectPay application to receive the response according to WYSIWIG form action.  

   The data for receiving the response according to WYSIWIG form action is first validated in the ECHO Hub system and is then passed to the SelectPay library. Based on the action, the following status responses can be obtained.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
