   This endpoint allows the API user to get the bank name associated with a routing number so that the payee can verify if the bank account is added correctly.  

   The data for getting the bank name is first validated in the ECHO Hub system and then the request is sent to the SelectPay library. Once, the bank name is obtained, ECHO Hub sends a success message along with the bank name.  
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
