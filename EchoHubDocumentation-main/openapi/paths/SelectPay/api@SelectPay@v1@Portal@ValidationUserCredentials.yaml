   This API will enable the SelectPay portal users to log in to the portal. When a user tries to log in to the portal, this endpoint validates the provided credentials against the payment number and zip. The endpoint returns the guest user token and other payment details.  

   The data for user verification is first validated in the ECHO Hub system, and the request is then sent to the SelectPay portal library. Once the user credentials are validated, the ECHO Hub will send a success message.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
